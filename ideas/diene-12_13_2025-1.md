## Readable gamefile

While an editor will eventually become a necessity, just having a file to describe aspects of a game (instead of having to write *everything* using code) would be quite nice.

A basic gamefile would need at least the following sections:

1. Environment variables
2. List of components
3. Attached code

Some game engines embed part 3 into part 2 by adding "Script" objects. However, keeping scripts in a separate category would reduce the complexity of our main program significantly.

## Small embedded language for game development

As Rust is somewhat janky for the purposes of this project---hence why it has been limited to use in the back-end---it would be useful to instead use a smaller scripting language like Lua. If this project requires it, a modified version of such a scripting language (similar in spirit to Roblox's Luau) may or may not prove necessary.
It is also an option to create a new scripting language from scratch.
