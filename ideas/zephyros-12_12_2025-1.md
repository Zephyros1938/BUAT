First idea log

## Idea 1

- We could have the rectangular prisms instead of being like roblox's solid color, potentially add an option for them to be gradients due to how we could draw things
- - This could easily be done, but i dont know how easy it would be for multi-gradient things (gradients containing more than 2 colors), as it would require adding extra vertices which could potentially be a lag problem long-term

## Idea 2

- Not exactly an idea, but most rendering will be done using EBOs (Element Buffer Objects) as they index a set of vertices, instead of repeating vertices
- - Most modern OBJ files do this instead of repeating vertices, so this should be standard
