## Standards for imports

I believe that we should atleast loosly follow the rust import standards, as it removes us having to use things such as `#[path = "gl/windowing.rs"]`

This is because when refactoring (ex: changing a filename/filepath), it does not change the path in quotes leading to some refactoring needing to be done by hand.

We should instead keep our importing like this:

```
src
└── client
    ├── graphics
    │   ├── camera.rs
    │   ├── shader.rs
    │   ├── texture.rs
    │   └── windowing.rs
    ├── graphics.rs
    ├── input
    │   └── mousehandler.rs
    ├── input.rs
    ├── main.rs
    ├── object
    │   ├── base.rs
    │   ├── mesh_loader.rs
    │   └── part.rs
    └── object.rs
```

This keeps the importing concise, and makes us only need to set our module imports like this:

```rs
mod graphics;
mod object;
mod input;

use {
    graphics::{
        camera::Camera3d,
        shader,
        windowing::{self, GameWindow, GameWindowHints},
    },
    input::mousehandler::MouseHandler,
    object::{base::Render, mesh_loader, part::Part},
};
```

## Version Standards

I dont think we should care a ton about how we do versioning unless we make a super large update (ex: rehauls of scripts that have a major effect, editing the api between server and client, etc.)

This is because i see literally no standards from rust on how to do versioning, so it should really just be left to us
