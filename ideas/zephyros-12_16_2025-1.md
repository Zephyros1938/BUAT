## Removing the `Render` trait

I decided that it would be more important with the new implementation of the ECS system, to instead of using the `Render` trait, to check if a Part has a `RenderData` component and a `Shader` component.

This makes the code honestly a lot easier to organize and the ECS a whole lot more complete.

I believe that this will help when making more objects as it removes the need for us to use traits, allowing for (*in the future*) to use `dyn Any` when having to do large iterations over certain things.

I also believe that we should try to make full use out of how an ECS works as it allows for much more complex operations than what we had previously with the `Part` struct.
